-------- Toddler Interactive Web Application --------

This project is an implementation of a web-based application designed for toddlers aged from 1-3. It aims to provide interactive activities to help toddlers develop various skills while keeping them entertained and focused.

-------- Features --------

- Incentives and Feedback: The application provides positive visual and audio feedback when a task/game is correctly completed. Conversely, negative visual or auditory feedback is given if a task/game is completed incorrectly.

- Progressive Difficulty: Activities get progressively harder as the child correctly completes tasks. This includes timed activities that increase in speed or contain more complex/longer levels.

- Creative Elements: The application incorporates creative elements such as drawing and cute/kiddy themes to help maintain the child's focus and engagement.

- Mouse Interaction: Games in the application utilize mouse interaction to help with finger movement and strength, aiding in the child's motor skill development.

- Main Menu Navigation: A main menu containing all games is provided, along with back-buttons in each activity to allow users to easily navigate back to the main menu.

-------- Contributors --------
