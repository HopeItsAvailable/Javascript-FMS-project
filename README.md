-------- Toddler Interactive Web Application --------

This project is an implementation of a web-based application designed for toddlers aged from 1-3. It aims to provide interactive activities to help toddlers develop various skills while keeping them entertained and focused.

-------- Features --------

- Incentives and Feedback: The application provides positive visual and audio feedback when a task/game is correctly completed. Conversely, negative visual or auditory feedback is given if a task/game is completed incorrectly.

- Progressive Difficulty: Activities get progressively harder as the child correctly completes tasks. This includes timed activities that increase in speed or contain more complex/longer levels.

- Creative Elements: The application incorporates creative elements such as drawing and cute/kiddy themes to help maintain the child's focus and engagement.

- Mouse Interaction: Games in the application utilize mouse interaction to help with finger movement and strength, aiding in the child's motor skill development.

- Main Menu Navigation: A main menu containing all games is provided, along with back-buttons in each activity to allow users to easily navigate back to the main menu.

-------- Contributors --------
This project was created by a team of 3 developers, each contributing to different aspects of the application. I primarily created the falling objects game and the main menu.

-------- Usage --------
To use the application, download the zip file and open the provided HTML file (index.html) in vscode with the p5.vscode extension or run directly in replit. From the main menu, users can select different activities/games to engage with. Use the mouse to interact with the games.
